🎥 Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard 🎥

I’m excited to share my latest project where I performed an in-depth analysis of Netflix content using Power BI. This analysis allowed me to explore key metrics and trends, such as:

📊 Top Movie Content-Creating Countries: The United States and India lead the way, creating the highest number of movies.

📅 Monthly Content Distribution: Insights into the number of monthly Netflix contents added.

🎞️ Top-Rated Categories: Dramas, Stand-Up Comedy, and International Movies rank high in Netflix's top-rated content.

📈 Movie vs TV Show Comparison: Movies make up a massive 97.25% of Netflix's content library compared to TV shows.

This dashboard was built using Power BI and showcases powerful visual insights through interactive elements such as:

Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and Line Charts to visualize content trends and distributions.

Slicers for directors, ratings, years, and content type, allow users to drill down into specific data points.
